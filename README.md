This is a list of projects, extensions and tools that are built around the [Archivy](https://archivy.github.io) knowledge base software.

The plugin system that facilitates the creation of these extensions was merged today, so the list is pretty sparse for now but if you make a plugin you'd like to share, please add it here and try to also a "category" in which it fits if you can't find any.

## Integrations

- [Git](https://github.com/archivy/archivy-git) - adds version control to your installation with automated pull / push to a remote repository.

## Digital Preservation

- The first archivy plugin, [`archivy-pocket`](https://github.com/archivy/archivy-pocket) - which allows you to sync your saved pocket bookmarks to archivy.
- [`archivy-hn`](https://github.com/archivy/archivy-hn) - sync your upvoted / favorited hacker news posts (including comments) to archivy.
